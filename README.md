# Like_Hero_To_Zero_IPWA02-01
Web application Prototype - #Spring Boot, #Beans, #JPA, #H2 Database

Task: You work in the web development team of a PR agency that supports various nature organizations and clubs. A major donor has provided funding for an app with the goal of developing a web frontend for a sustainability project called "Like Hero To Zero." It will display publicly accessible data on global CO2 emissions (without a login). The web application should also have a backend interface (with login) that registered scientists can use to add new data or correct data errors.

The requirements engineer has already discussed the following user stories in advance with selected members of NABU, BUND, and other clubs. They have stored the following user stories in the product backlog and prioritized them using the MoSCoW method:

1. MUST: As a citizen interested in environmental policy, I want to be able to read the most recent CO2 emissions data available in the dataset for the country of my citizenship.

2. MUST: As a registered data contributor, I want to include the most recent data from my climate research in the dataset.

3. COULD: As the editor of the dataset, I want to ensure that any additions or changes to the data must first be approved.
